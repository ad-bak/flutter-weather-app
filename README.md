# Weather API Test

This is a simple test for a Weather API using Flutter. The application fetches and displays weather data based on the user's location. It uses packages like `geolocator` for location services and `weather` for fetching weather data. The main logic is handled in the `WeatherBlocBloc` class in `lib/bloc/weather_bloc_bloc.dart`, and the main UI is in `lib/screens/home_screen.dart`.
